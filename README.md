# Backend Interview Preparation

Intensive preparation for Senior Backend Developer role with focus on **backend security, authentication systems, and SOC2 compliance**.

**Timeline:** October 2024 (2 weeks intensive prep)

## What I Built

### Core Projects
- **[Day 2: REST API with TypeScript](./day2-express-ts-api)**
  - Full CRUD API with Express + TypeScript
  - Input validation with Zod
  - Error handling middleware
  - Production-ready architecture

- **Day 3: JWT Authentication System**
  - Secure password hashing with bcrypt
  - JWT token generation and verification
  - Protected routes with auth middleware
  - Role-based access control patterns

- **Day 4: PostgreSQL Database Integration**
  - Prisma ORM for type-safe queries
  - Database migrations
  - Secure database architecture
  - SQL injection prevention

- **Day 5: GraphQL API Layer** (in day2 repo)
  - Apollo Server integration
  - Type-safe schemas and resolvers
  - Authentication context
  - Query optimization

### Security Deep-Dive Studies
- **[OWASP Top 10](./security-study/owasp-top-10-notes.md)** - Understanding and preventing common vulnerabilities
- **[SOC2 Compliance](./security-study/soc2-compliance-notes.md)** - 5 Trust Service Criteria for financial platforms

## Security Focus

Key security implementations across projects:
- Authentication & Authorization (JWT, RBAC)
- Password Security (bcrypt hashing, complexity requirements)
- Input Validation (Zod schemas)
- Injection Prevention (Prisma ORM, parameterized queries)
- Access Control (ownership verification on all protected routes)
- Error Handling (safe error messages, audit logging)

## Technologies

**Backend:** TypeScript, Node.js, Express.js  
**Database:** PostgreSQL, Prisma ORM  
**API:** REST, GraphQL (Apollo Server)  
**Security:** JWT, bcrypt, Zod validation  
**Tools:** Git, npm, VS Code

## Key Learnings

- **Security-first development** - OWASP Top 10, SOC2 principles
- **Type safety** - TypeScript throughout the stack
- **Modern backend patterns** - ORM, middleware, authentication flows
- **Compliance thinking** - Audit logging, access controls, data protection
